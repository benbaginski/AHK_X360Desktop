### X360Desktop

This is the first release of X360 Desktop. This script is an amalgamation of Scoox's "HoverScroll()", AutoHotKey's "Using A Joystick as a Mouse," and my own additions.

This release contains the following features:
* Simultaneous coarse and fine grain mouse control.
* Mapped buttons for left, right and middle mouse buttons and shift, control, Forward, Back, and Windows.
* Smooth scroll using triggers.
* Alt-tab functionality using D-Pad left and right.
* Adjustable speed mouse control
* Configurable button assignments

You can access the original scripts by Scoox and AutoHotKey here:
